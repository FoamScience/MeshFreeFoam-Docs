{{< alert title="Note:" >}}
The unit tests pages are automatically generated from the test reports. Some important points to mention:
- The random number generator is seeded with the same seed for parallel/serial runs for the same test case.
- Number of passing tests is the "effective" one (including the ones that fail but are expected to fail)".
- Number of failing tests is the "effective" one (only the ones that fail and are not expected to fail)".

## Serial unit tests for `nanoflannKDTree` in `meshfree` library on `[advectionDiffusion]` case

Tests were performed using [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) version `3.6.0` (rng-seed: `379859153`) with the following filters: `[serial] [advectionDiffusion] [#nanoflannKDTreeTests]`.

<i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-check -text-primary"></i> <span class="-text-primary">14 Passing</span> test cases  (<span class="-text-primary">112</span> expressions), <i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation -text-warning"></i> <span class="-text-warning">0 Failing</span> test cases  (<span class="-text-warning">0</span> expressions).
